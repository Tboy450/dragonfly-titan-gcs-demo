# Change Log and Handoff Record

Every change or addition to this project is recorded here, newest first, and **signed** by
whoever made it, so the next person or assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or a human) can see
what was done, why, and what is still open.

## How to add an entry

Add your entry at the top of **Entries** in the same commit as the change:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- **Signed:** <assistant or person> (<model / tool>)
- **Commit:** <commit subject> (find it with `git log --grep "<subject>"`)
- **What changed:** plain-language summary
- **Files:** main files touched
- **Assumptions:** anything estimated or invented, and how it is labeled in the app
- **Checks:** tests run and manual checks
- **Open / next:** follow-ups for the next session
```

Notes for every session:
- The git author on this machine is "Heemi" for all commits, so the signature here (and a
  `Co-Authored-By` line in the commit message) is how authorship is tracked.
- Research sources, tags ([PUB]/[CALC]/[EST]) and the implementation status table live in
  `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0, §7 and §8. Update them when you finish an item there.
- Publishing: pushing to `main` on GitHub runs the tests and publishes `dist` to GitHub Pages.
  The local branch here is `master` tracking `origin/main`: `git push origin master:main`.
- Leave every `?v=dev` stamp and the "Build local" label as they are. The publish workflow
  replaces them with the commit hash (see `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

## Entries

### 2026-09-28: Rain-darkened interdune replaces the fictional lake
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Replace the fictional lake with a rain-darkened interdune and methane puddle"
- **What changed:** The large hydrocarbon pool is gone. In its place: a broad patch of
  rain-darkened damp ground (darker, slightly glossy, ragged edge; safe to land on) around a
  small methane puddle (about 22 x 15 m; still a no-landing zone). The puddle's surface is set
  just below the lowest surrounding ground so liquid never floats above its banks. The survey
  is renamed "Interdune survey"; the target is the "Dry outcrop" at the patch's edge, kept dry.
  The small track map now shows the damp area (dashed) and the puddle.
- **Files:** `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`, `dist/flight-model.mjs`,
  `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `tests/terrain.test.mjs`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** geography and sizes are training choices [EST]. Basis [PUB]: Dragonfly lands
  near the equator, far from the polar seas; methane storms darkened ~500,000 km² of
  equatorial ground in 2010 (JPL 2011). See `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §5 "Realism note".
- **Checks:** 39 tests pass (new: damp ground landable, puddle below its banks); visual check
  of the puddle and damp ground in the pilot view.

### 2026-09-28: Titan haze lighting and a moving high-gain antenna
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add Titan haze lighting and a raise-and-stow high-gain antenna"
- **What changed:**
  - 3D pilot view lighting now reads as Titan: an orange sky dome carries most of the light,
    direct sunlight is weak (faint, soft shadows), the sky is a gradient (bright orange
    horizon, deeper amber overhead), and night is much darker. The Mission view's vehicle
    portrait keeps neutral lighting.
  - The high-gain antenna now sits on a motorized arm. "Start downlink" raises it (about 6 s)
    and aims it along the sunlight (Earth stays within ~6 deg of the Sun from Titan); data only
    flows once it is fully raised. Any flight command ends the downlink, the vehicle shows
    "Stowing antenna" and lifts off once the arm is down. The takeoff command is kept.
  - Local copies only (localhost): `window.dragonflyState` exposes the live state for
    debugging. It is not defined on the published site.
- **Files:** `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`, `dist/mission-systems.mjs`,
  `dist/flight-model.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `tests/operations.test.mjs`
- **Assumptions:** light colors and intensities are an artistic rendering [EST], kept bright
  enough for phones (real surface light is ~1/1,000 of Earth's [PUB]). Fog gives ~3.6 km
  visibility instead of the published ~10 km so the 4.9 km terrain edge stays hidden [EST].
  The 6 s antenna travel time is [EST]; the raise-for-comms, stow-for-flight behavior is [PUB].
- **Checks:** 38 tests pass (downlink test now covers the raise delay, stow-before-liftoff and
  the kept takeoff command); checked in the browser at desktop size.
- **Open / next:** the Mission view's 2D top-down drawing does not show the raised antenna.

### 2026-09-28: Signed change log, on-screen build label, automatic version stamping
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add signed change log, build label and automatic version stamping"
- **What changed:**
  - Added this change log with entries back-filled for today's earlier Claude commits.
  - The header now shows the live build ("Build 1a2b3c4 · 2026-09-28") next to the
    "New Frontiers Demo" tag, so a phone shows at a glance which version it has. Local copies
    show "Build local".
  - All cache-busting stamps in the source are now `?v=dev`. The GitHub publish step replaces
    them with the commit hash on every release, so nobody has to bump version numbers by hand.
- **Files:** `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, `dist/index.html`,
  `dist/styles.css`, `dist/*.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `tests/cache-version.test.mjs`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** none (build date uses US Eastern time).
- **Checks:** 38 tests pass; the stamp step was run on a copy of `dist` (all 14 references
  stamped, vendor files untouched).
- **Open / next:** see the entries above this one as they are added.

### 2026-09-28: Clean up heat-exchanger reference images
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `9ac134f` "Clean up heat-exchanger reference images"
- **What changed:** Removed phone and Google Lens interface elements from the two
  shell-and-tube reference images (status strip, app header, Lens button, Visit buttons,
  truncating ellipsis). Restored the "Channel" and "Tubeside" labels the Lens button covered
  ("Tubeside" and the "Fl" of "Flow In" were copied from the matching labels in the same
  drawing; "Channel" was redrawn in Segoe UI Semibold).
- **Files:** `dist/assets/heat-exchanger-reference.jpg`, `dist/assets/tubetech-reference.jpg`,
  `dist/index.html`
- **Checks:** visual comparison at 3x zoom; the originals remain in git history (`b724b4b`).

### 2026-09-28: Professional wording for the exchanger figures
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `b724b4b` "Reword heat-exchanger figure captions and study notes"
- **What changed:** Replaced "User-supplied ..." captions and alt text with neutral figure
  captions. Reworded the Lockheed Martin note and the "claims ... not corroborated" line so
  they state what the public sources do and do not describe, without implying a user error.
- **Files:** `dist/index.html`, `README.md`

### 2026-09-28: Cache-busting stamps for phones
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `31827cd` "Version module and stylesheet URLs so phones load fresh files"
- **What changed:** Added `?v=` stamps to every module import, the stylesheet and `app.js`,
  so phones stop mixing cached old modules with new ones (the cause of the "stuck on an old
  version" reports). Superseded by the automatic stamping entry above.
- **Files:** `dist/*`, `tests/cache-version.test.mjs`, `README.md`

### 2026-09-28: Motor preheat, daylight comms, flight endurance, wind stress labels
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `1030402` "Add motor preheat, daylight comms, flight endurance and wind stress labels"
- **What changed:** 60 Wh motor preheat per cold start; Direct-to-Earth link only when landed,
  awake and in daylight (antenna stowed in flight), with a manual 200 W downlink and data
  counter; flight time left (battery reserve vs 35 C battery limit), 30-minute flight timer and
  "Land now" / night-flight advisories; wind above 1.6 m/s labeled as a stress test.
- **Files:** `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`,
  `tests/operations.test.mjs`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** 200 W DC downlink draw, 9.5 AU Earth range and 30-minute motor cool-down
  are [EST]; data rate uses the 2018 concept's ~5 mJ/bit/AU [PUB].

### 2026-09-28: Smooth flight controls, mode-change fixes, phone layouts
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `3bb6cd4` "Smooth flight controls, fix mode-change jumps, and rebuild phone layouts"
- **What changed:** One rate-limited flight model for all modes, sticky/centering throttle,
  Auto resumes from the matching phase, no terrain re-centering jumps, eased chase camera,
  new portrait and landscape phone layouts. Details in `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0.

### Earlier history (unsigned)
Commits before `3bb6cd4` carry no assistant signature. Per `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0,
`74ed2c4` ("Refine Titan thermal and flight models from published research") was made by
GPT/Codex. `RESEARCH-FOLLOWUP.md` records the GPT/Codex review of Claude's research handoff.
