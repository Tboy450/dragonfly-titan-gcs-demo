# Change Log and Handoff Record

Every change or addition to this project is recorded here, newest first, and **signed** by
whoever made it, so the next person or assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Codex or a human) can see
what was done, why, and what is still open.

## How to add an entry

Add your entry at the top of **Entries** in the same commit as the change:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD: short title
- **Signed:** <assistant or person> (<model / tool>)
- **Commit:** <commit subject> (find it with `git log --grep "<subject>"`)
- **What changed:** plain-language summary
- **Files:** main files touched
- **Assumptions:** anything estimated or invented, and how it is labeled in the app
- **Checks:** tests run and manual checks
- **Open / next:** follow-ups for the next session
```

Notes for every session:
- The git author on this machine is "Heemi" for all commits, so the signature here (and a
  `Co-Authored-By` line in the commit message) is how authorship is tracked.
- Research sources, tags ([PUB]/[CALC]/[EST]) and the implementation status table live in
  `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0, §7 and §8. Update them when you finish an item there.
- Publishing: pushing to `main` on GitHub runs the tests and publishes `dist` to GitHub Pages.
  The local branch here is `master` tracking `origin/main`: `git push origin master:main`.
- Leave every `?v=dev` stamp and the "Build local" label as they are. The publish workflow
  replaces them with the commit hash (see `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

## Entries

### 2026-09-29: Arrival sequence framing for phones
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Zoom out on the parachute phases of the arrival sequence"
- **What changed:** While the parachutes are out the camera now pulls back about 3x (drogue
  40 -> 120 m, main 66 -> 190 m; entry capsule 16 -> 30 m), so the whole ~40 m capsule-and-parachute
  rig fits on a phone screen at about a third of its former size. After release at 1 km the camera
  eases back in to the lander (12 m) as it flies down. During the arrival the scene is centered in
  the space above the caption strip instead of being shifted up for the (hidden) pilot controls,
  which had pushed the parachute off the top of phone screens.
- **Files:** `dist/edl.mjs`, `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`
- **Checks:** 58 tests pass; frames captured at 375 x 812 at entry, drogue, main, pose,
  pre-release, after release and near touchdown.

### 2026-09-29: Internal-parts and thermal layers, shared Mission/Pilot readouts, slimmer arrival caption
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add internal and thermal vehicle layers and link Mission and Pilot readouts"
- **What changed:**
  - **Vehicle Layers panel** under the Mission diagram: Exterior / Internal / Thermal.
    Internal and Thermal show the NASA 2023 design in a fixed three-quarter view with the nose to
    the left (like the published thermal figures); the foam shell and HGA disc turn see-through.
  - **Interior (18 labeled parts)** placed from ICES-2023-389 (text p2-p7, figs. 3-4) and the TFAWS
    2023 top view, in the same coordinates as the exterior: nose bulkhead; navigation/forward
    cameras in the unheated nose; IMUs and lidar FEB/MEB at the base of the nose; cold attic with
    the DrACO sample carousel; the insulating "wonderwall"; warm attic with DraMS (mass spectrometer
    and laser with fan); two rotorcraft drive electronics boxes; HGA az/el actuators; avionics,
    power and radio boxes; the TWTA under the top deck; the battery (11.5 kWh, 7.5 kg PCM, heat
    pipes) at the aft end; aft bulkhead; circulation fan; under-floor duct; trim-device chimneys
    (43 x 34 cm, both sides); plus the METHAN/E-field sensors, side camera suites and DrACO blower
    outside. Animated arrows follow the published air loop: MMRTG -> fan -> under-floor duct ->
    into the body below the nose -> aft through the bay -> back into the MMRTG.
  - **Thermal layer** colors every part by live temperature on a whole-lander (-180 to +40 C) or
    inside (-30 to +40 C) scale with a legend. New display-only nodes for the RDEs, TWTA and nose
    electronics are calibrated to the published end-of-leapfrog figure (RDEs near 300 K, nothing
    above 35 C); cold-attic, nose-camera and actuator temperatures are placed relative to the bay
    from the hot-hibernation figure. Each value is tagged modeled / estimate / published.
  - Numbered callouts on the diagram (nudged apart) and a parts list with live temperatures;
    tapping either highlights a part and shows its temperature, value source and placement source.
  - **Linked readouts:** a compact systems strip in the Pilot view (battery % and temperature, bay
    air, flight time left, link, plan status) reads the same live values as the Mission panels.
  - **Arrival caption** is now a slim see-through strip along the bottom (one line plus at most
    two lines of detail on phones; about 20% of the view on a 375 px screen) with a small Skip.
- **Files:** `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/thermal-scale.mjs` (new),
  `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `dist/styles.css`, `tests/render-smoke.test.mjs`,
  `README.md`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`
- **Assumptions:** [PUB] part list and their described locations, air loop, foam thickness,
  chimney size, fan flow, battery PCM, "nothing exceeds 35 C", "internal components no colder than
  -20 C", published temperature ranges in figs. 3-4. [EST] exact box sizes and positions where the
  papers give only a region (read from the figures), and the display-node heat inputs, time
  constants and zone offsets. Unnamed boxes in NASA's figures are not drawn.
- **Checks:** 58 tests pass (new: every interior part fits inside the 7.62 cm-foam cavity of the
  exterior, attic parts under the attic roof, chimneys in the side walls; layers return on-screen
  callouts for all labeled parts and the pilot view restores the exterior). Checked in the page by
  stepping the real frame loop: Internal and Thermal captures at desktop size, parts list and
  selection, and the arrival caption and Pilot strip at 375 x 812.

### 2026-09-29: Working science instruments and data return
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Make the science instruments produce data, samples and results"
- **What changed:**
  - **DragonCam** images in flight (frame count) and fills an onboard data store.
  - **DraGMet** shows temperature, pressure, wind and methane humidity; its seismometer
    records an occasional event during long quiet stays on the ground (science log).
  - **DraGNS** counts while landed and shows the ground's bulk makeup (water ice vs organics)
    with an uncertainty that shrinks with counting time; moving starts a new measurement.
  - **Sample here (DrACO + DraMS)** drills anywhere on dry, stationary ground: 30 s, ~160 W,
    +40 Mbit, and a result that depends on the ground (ice-rich outcrop, rain-dampened sand,
    organic interdune sand). The survey mission's own sampling is unchanged.
  - **Downlink** now sends stored data (Comms shows stored, returned and time to send) and ends
    when the store is empty; a 1x / 20x / 100x speed control appears during a downlink, because
    at ~4 kbit/s data return, not flying, is the bottleneck [PUB §3.5].
  - Local copies only: `window.dragonflyTick` exposes the frame loop for testing while the
    browser tab is hidden (not defined on the published site).
- **Files:** `dist/science.mjs` (new), `dist/flight-model.mjs`, `dist/mission-systems.mjs`,
  `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `dist/styles.css`, `tests/science.test.mjs` (new),
  `README.md`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`
- **Assumptions:** [PUB] instrument roles (compendium §2.3), DraMS electronics ~120 W, the data
  bottleneck. [EST] every data rate and volume, the 30 s sample time, the seismic event rate,
  ~45% methane humidity shown, the ground types and every result text (labeled in the app as
  illustrative examples, not mission data).
- **Checks:** 56 tests pass (new: ground types, camera data, DraGNS precision, sampling rules,
  power and interruption, downlink drain and stop, seismometer). Checked in the page by
  stepping the real frame loop: sampling at the outcrop, science log, downlink at 100x.

### 2026-09-29: Arrival at Titan opening sequence (entry, descent and landing)
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add the arrival-at-Titan entry, descent and landing sequence"
- **What changed:** A one-minute, time-compressed opening sequence plays on a browser's first
  visit (Skip button; "Replay the arrival at Titan" in the footer). It follows the published EDL
  timeline: entry interface at 1,270 km with the capsule spinning at 2 rpm, peak heating
  (245 km, heat-shield glow), peak deceleration, the 8.25 m drogue at 143 km, the 16.7 m main
  at 4.8 km, heat-shield separation at 4.4 km, thermal-loop switch, lander pose (lowered on
  bridles below the backshell), despin with rotor spin-up, lidar ground lock, release at 1,000 m
  at 2.9 m/s, then powered flight away from the backshell to touchdown at base. A caption panel
  shows each step with the real altitude and time since entry; the sky darkens toward black at
  high altitude. The research model's exterior was also refined to the TFAWS 2023 top view at
  327 px/m (fuselage and MMRTG ~13 cm further aft; body 3.85 m nose to MMRTG end), with the
  pixel-to-model mapping written in `chase-vehicle.mjs` so the planned internal-parts layer
  can be placed from the same drawing and fit the exterior.
- **Files:** `dist/edl.mjs` (new), `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`,
  `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `dist/styles.css`, `tests/edl.test.mjs` (new),
  `tests/render-smoke.test.mjs`, `README.md`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`
- **Assumptions:** [PUB] every altitude, time since entry, parachute size, aeroshell size and
  mass, release window and rate (SciTech 2025 EDL overview fig. 1; compendium §2.4). [EST] the
  time compression, capsule/parachute colors, riser and bridle lengths, the backshell shape,
  the spin shown at one third of 2 rpm, the powered-descent profile and touchdown at base. The
  lander is hidden while enclosed because its tail fins would poke through the simplified shell.
- **Checks:** 51 tests pass (new: published altitudes, monotonic descent without jumps, ordered
  hardware events, 3D smoke test through every phase). Frames rendered in the browser at entry,
  drogue, main/heat-shield separation, pose, lidar lock and powered flight.

### 2026-09-29: Research-based 3D vehicle model, land-now fix, 3D smoke tests
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add a research-based Dragonfly model and fix land-now timing"
- **What changed:**
  - New default 3D model built from the NASA/APL design drawings in the supplied PDFs
    (TFAWS 2023 "Dragonfly Lander Overview" slide 3 with labeled parts and a top view;
    ICES-2020-160 fig. 1; ICES-2023-389 fig. 1; TFAWS 2024 slide 3): long insulated fuselage,
    rounded "attic" over the nose, finned MMRTG at the tail between two tall splayed fins, four
    arms angled toward the ends carrying the coaxial three-blade rotors (disks ~R/2 apart), wide
    thick skids on legs with a drill housing on each, a flat 0.874 m radial-line-slot HGA disc
    (stowed flat, raised and aimed for downlink), LGA and MGA, nose cameras/lidar and two
    instrument booms. A **Model** button in the vehicle view switches to the original model for
    comparison (remembered per browser).
  - Measured envelope in the tests: 3.87 x 3.83 x 1.81 m vs published 3.85 x 3.85 x 1.75 m.
  - Parts are grouped into named subsystems, each tagged with a thermal zone, to prepare for
    the planned Mission-view exterior/thermal/internal layers (design notes in
    `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` "Future update requests").
  - Fixes from the Codex review (2026-09-28): (1) the half-finished model edit called a removed
    `poseAntenna()` and stopped rendering; fixed. (2) "Land now" used a fixed 3-minute trigger
    that ignored descent time (a 400 m descent at 1.3 m/s takes ~5 min); it now triggers when
    flight time left falls below the descent time plus 1.5 min (never below 3 min), both for the
    autopilot and the manual-flight advisory.
  - New tests drive the whole 3D scene without a GPU (stand-in renderer), so a rendering crash
    like (1) now fails the test suite.
- **Files:** `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `dist/styles.css`,
  `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/flight-plan.mjs`, `tests/render-smoke.test.mjs` (new),
  `tests/flight-plan.test.mjs`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** [PUB] envelope, rotor count/diameter/blades, coaxial spacing, MMRTG size, HGA
  diameter, the labeled part layout. [EST] exact proportions (measured from the drawings using
  the MMRTG as scale, ~317 px/m), colors, fin outline, boom positions, arm sweep. Rotors keep
  three blades per the 2026 engineer interview although the 2023 drawings show two.
- **Checks:** 48 tests pass (new: 3D smoke test over both models, antenna poses, day/night and
  both views; envelope check; subsystem tagging; land-now from 400 m lands above the reserve).
  Frames rendered in the browser and compared with the NASA drawings (quarter, side, top,
  Mission view).

### 2026-09-28: Future Mission vehicle-layer views requested
- **Signed:** Codex (OpenAI, Codex desktop app)
- **What changed:** Added the user's future-update request for exterior, thermal, and internal-parts/cutaway views in the Mission vehicle window to `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`.
- **Scope:** Backlog documentation only. No simulator changes, commit, or deployment in this review.
- **Open / next:** Implement later; distinguish modeled thermal values and illustrative internals from verified hardware details.

### 2026-09-28: Mission planning mode and leapfrog scouting
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add autonomous flight planning with leapfrog scouting"
- **What changed:**
  - New **Plan flight** button opens a map: tap up to 6 waypoints (tap a site to snap to it),
    pick 40 m hop / 150 m scouting / 400 m cruise (nominal) altitude, and read a live estimate
    (distance, time, energy incl. preheat, battery % and temperature at landing, sites it will
    scout) with a GO / NO-GO verdict and reasons.
  - **Uplink plan** simulates the signal delay (8 s here, 73-90 min for real), then the lander
    flies itself: climb, cruise through the waypoints, descend and land. A strip under the
    mission bar shows progress, a 1x / 5x / 20x time-speed control and **Stop plan** (holds
    position). Afterwards it reports actual vs estimated time and energy.
  - **Leapfrog rule:** the last waypoint must be a scouted site. Base and the Dry outcrop start
    scouted; six candidate interdune sites (A-F, 0.3-1.9 km out, chosen for low relief and
    given level 10 m landing circles) turn from amber to green when any flight passes within
    60 m of them at 20 m or higher. The 3D view shows each site's 10 m safe landing circle.
  - **Land-now fault response:** during a plan, if flight time left drops under 3 minutes
    (energy reserve or 35 C battery), the autopilot descends where it is.
  - Manual control, any flight command, the guided survey or a safety restriction stops a plan.
  - The flight-profile chart's altitude scale now grows with the flight instead of clipping at 65 m.
- **Files:** `dist/flight-plan.mjs` (new), `dist/flight-model.mjs`, `dist/mission-systems.mjs`,
  `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`, `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`,
  `dist/styles.css`, `tests/flight-plan.test.mjs` (new), `README.md`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`
- **Assumptions:** [PUB] no real-time piloting, uplinked autonomous flights, leapfrog scouting,
  ~10 m safe landing circle, ~400 m nominal cruise, ~30 min longest flights, land-now fault
  response. [EST] 2.5 m/s planned climb, 10 m/s cruise, 60 m scouting radius at 20 m+,
  8 s compressed uplink, candidate site positions, the 3-minute land-now trigger. Descent is
  limited to the simulator's existing 1.3 m/s landing profile.
- **Checks:** 44 tests pass, including a full autonomous flight (uplink wait, climb to 150 m,
  scouting Site A, landing inside the 10 m circle, energy within 0.75-1.35x of the estimate),
  leapfrog follow-up, abort, land-now and level/dry site checks. Planning dialog checked in the
  browser (sites, GO/NO-GO, estimate). The flight itself was not watched in the browser because
  the browser pane was hidden; it is covered by the tests.
- **Open / next:** no uplink of plans at Titan night (real ops) is modeled only as a NO-GO check.

### 2026-09-28: Redirect page to retire the ChatGPT Sites copy (prepared, not yet published)
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add a redirect page for retiring the ChatGPT Sites copy"
- **What changed:** Added `sites-redirect/index.html`, a small page that forwards visitors
  from the old chatgpt.site copy to the GitHub Pages version, with publishing instructions in
  `sites-redirect/README.md`. GitHub Pages is unaffected.
- **Findings:** the `sites` git remote's latest commit (`6890413`, Sep 21) does not match what
  the chatgpt.site URL serves, so that site is published through ChatGPT's own pipeline;
  pushing to the remote alone may not change it.
- **Open / next:** publish the redirect from ChatGPT (or push it to the `sites` remote) once the
  owner approves.

### 2026-09-28: Rain-darkened interdune replaces the fictional lake
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Replace the fictional lake with a rain-darkened interdune and methane puddle"
- **What changed:** The large hydrocarbon pool is gone. In its place: a broad patch of
  rain-darkened damp ground (darker, slightly glossy, ragged edge; safe to land on) around a
  small methane puddle (about 22 x 15 m; still a no-landing zone). The puddle's surface is set
  just below the lowest surrounding ground so liquid never floats above its banks. The survey
  is renamed "Interdune survey"; the target is the "Dry outcrop" at the patch's edge, kept dry.
  The small track map now shows the damp area (dashed) and the puddle.
- **Files:** `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`, `dist/flight-model.mjs`,
  `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`, `tests/terrain.test.mjs`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** geography and sizes are training choices [EST]. Basis [PUB]: Dragonfly lands
  near the equator, far from the polar seas; methane storms darkened ~500,000 km² of
  equatorial ground in 2010 (JPL 2011). See `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §5 "Realism note".
- **Checks:** 39 tests pass (new: damp ground landable, puddle below its banks); visual check
  of the puddle and damp ground in the pilot view.

### 2026-09-28: Titan haze lighting and a moving high-gain antenna
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add Titan haze lighting and a raise-and-stow high-gain antenna"
- **What changed:**
  - 3D pilot view lighting now reads as Titan: an orange sky dome carries most of the light,
    direct sunlight is weak (faint, soft shadows), the sky is a gradient (bright orange
    horizon, deeper amber overhead), and night is much darker. The Mission view's vehicle
    portrait keeps neutral lighting.
  - The high-gain antenna now sits on a motorized arm. "Start downlink" raises it (about 6 s)
    and aims it along the sunlight (Earth stays within ~6 deg of the Sun from Titan); data only
    flows once it is fully raised. Any flight command ends the downlink, the vehicle shows
    "Stowing antenna" and lifts off once the arm is down. The takeoff command is kept.
  - Local copies only (localhost): `window.dragonflyState` exposes the live state for
    debugging. It is not defined on the published site.
- **Files:** `dist/chase-vehicle.mjs`, `dist/titan-terrain.mjs`, `dist/mission-systems.mjs`,
  `dist/flight-model.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `tests/operations.test.mjs`
- **Assumptions:** light colors and intensities are an artistic rendering [EST], kept bright
  enough for phones (real surface light is ~1/1,000 of Earth's [PUB]). Fog gives ~3.6 km
  visibility instead of the published ~10 km so the 4.9 km terrain edge stays hidden [EST].
  The 6 s antenna travel time is [EST]; the raise-for-comms, stow-for-flight behavior is [PUB].
- **Checks:** 38 tests pass (downlink test now covers the raise delay, stow-before-liftoff and
  the kept takeoff command); checked in the browser at desktop size.
- **Open / next:** the Mission view's 2D top-down drawing does not show the raised antenna.

### 2026-09-28: Signed change log, on-screen build label, automatic version stamping
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** "Add signed change log, build label and automatic version stamping"
- **What changed:**
  - Added this change log with entries back-filled for today's earlier Claude commits.
  - The header now shows the live build ("Build 1a2b3c4 · 2026-09-28") next to the
    "New Frontiers Demo" tag, so a phone shows at a glance which version it has. Local copies
    show "Build local".
  - All cache-busting stamps in the source are now `?v=dev`. The GitHub publish step replaces
    them with the commit hash on every release, so nobody has to bump version numbers by hand.
- **Files:** `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/workflows/pages.yml`, `dist/index.html`,
  `dist/styles.css`, `dist/*.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `tests/cache-version.test.mjs`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** none (build date uses US Eastern time).
- **Checks:** 38 tests pass; the stamp step was run on a copy of `dist` (all 14 references
  stamped, vendor files untouched).
- **Open / next:** see the entries above this one as they are added.

### 2026-09-28: Clean up heat-exchanger reference images
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `9ac134f` "Clean up heat-exchanger reference images"
- **What changed:** Removed phone and Google Lens interface elements from the two
  shell-and-tube reference images (status strip, app header, Lens button, Visit buttons,
  truncating ellipsis). Restored the "Channel" and "Tubeside" labels the Lens button covered
  ("Tubeside" and the "Fl" of "Flow In" were copied from the matching labels in the same
  drawing; "Channel" was redrawn in Segoe UI Semibold).
- **Files:** `dist/assets/heat-exchanger-reference.jpg`, `dist/assets/tubetech-reference.jpg`,
  `dist/index.html`
- **Checks:** visual comparison at 3x zoom; the originals remain in git history (`b724b4b`).

### 2026-09-28: Professional wording for the exchanger figures
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `b724b4b` "Reword heat-exchanger figure captions and study notes"
- **What changed:** Replaced "User-supplied ..." captions and alt text with neutral figure
  captions. Reworded the Lockheed Martin note and the "claims ... not corroborated" line so
  they state what the public sources do and do not describe, without implying a user error.
- **Files:** `dist/index.html`, `README.md`

### 2026-09-28: Cache-busting stamps for phones
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `31827cd` "Version module and stylesheet URLs so phones load fresh files"
- **What changed:** Added `?v=` stamps to every module import, the stylesheet and `app.js`,
  so phones stop mixing cached old modules with new ones (the cause of the "stuck on an old
  version" reports). Superseded by the automatic stamping entry above.
- **Files:** `dist/*`, `tests/cache-version.test.mjs`, `README.md`

### 2026-09-28: Motor preheat, daylight comms, flight endurance, wind stress labels
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `1030402` "Add motor preheat, daylight comms, flight endurance and wind stress labels"
- **What changed:** 60 Wh motor preheat per cold start; Direct-to-Earth link only when landed,
  awake and in daylight (antenna stowed in flight), with a manual 200 W downlink and data
  counter; flight time left (battery reserve vs 35 C battery limit), 30-minute flight timer and
  "Land now" / night-flight advisories; wind above 1.6 m/s labeled as a stress test.
- **Files:** `dist/mission-systems.mjs`, `dist/app.js`, `dist/index.html`,
  `tests/operations.test.mjs`, `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md`, `README.md`
- **Assumptions:** 200 W DC downlink draw, 9.5 AU Earth range and 30-minute motor cool-down
  are [EST]; data rate uses the 2018 concept's ~5 mJ/bit/AU [PUB].

### 2026-09-28: Smooth flight controls, mode-change fixes, phone layouts
- **Signed:** Claude (Anthropic Claude Opus 5.5, Claude Code desktop app)
- **Commit:** `3bb6cd4` "Smooth flight controls, fix mode-change jumps, and rebuild phone layouts"
- **What changed:** One rate-limited flight model for all modes, sticky/centering throttle,
  Auto resumes from the matching phase, no terrain re-centering jumps, eased chase camera,
  new portrait and landscape phone layouts. Details in `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0.

### Earlier history (unsigned)
Commits before `3bb6cd4` carry no assistant signature. Per `RESEARCH-COMPENDIUM.md` §0,
`74ed2c4` ("Refine Titan thermal and flight models from published research") was made by
GPT/Codex. `RESEARCH-FOLLOWUP.md` records the GPT/Codex review of Claude's research handoff.
